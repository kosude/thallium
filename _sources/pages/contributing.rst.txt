Building For Development
------------------------

When building the project for development, make sure to use the ``-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug`` flag. It is also recommended to compile test executables
in this case.


Adding To The Documentation
---------------------------

Document **all** new public functions or types with `Doxygen <https://www.doxygen.nl/>`_-style formatting. Also see the
`Breathe documentation <https://breathe.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html>`_ to find out how to include your code's documentation in the HTML
output.


Resources
---------

I keep an upstream TO-DO list on `Trello <https://trello.com/b/ZHYGTiZr/thallium-development-tracking>`_. Submit issues and pull requests to the
`GitHub repo <https://github.com/kosude/thallium>`_.
