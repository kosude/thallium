Functions
---------


For Cocoa (macOS) systems
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. important::
    Definitions for these functions is compiled **only if** the ``-DTHALLIUM_WSI_COCOA=ON`` CMake flag was present at build. This is the
    **default behaviour** on **Apple** systems.

.. doxygenfunction:: TL_WindowSurfaceCreateCocoa


For X11 systems - via XCB
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. important::
    Definitions for these functions is compiled **only if** the ``-DTHALLIUM_WSI_XCB=ON`` CMake flag was present at build. This is the
    **default behaviour** on **Unix** *(not Apple)* systems.

.. doxygenfunction:: TL_WindowSurfaceCreateXCB


For X11 systems - via Xlib
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. important::
    Definitions for these functions is compiled **only if** the ``-DTHALLIUM_WSI_XLIB=ON`` CMake flag was present at build. This is the
    **default behaviour** on **Unix** *(not Apple)* systems.

.. doxygenfunction:: TL_WindowSurfaceCreateXlib
